*finish input fields (with radio dials and stuff on new page)
    *get the date input to work on Safari desktop
*make the 'now playing' box stay checked in edit if it was previously true
*display 'now playing' === true as 'Now playing' graphic
*card elements should be clickable and list all games that fit that (genre, platform, release year)
