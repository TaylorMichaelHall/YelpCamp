#todo
<!--*add types section to edit page and index page-->
<!--*style types to be little buttons-->
<!--*check DB to see if the deleted items are gone or if they're just removed from view--> 
    <!--they are removed entirely from the collection as far as I can tell-->
<!--**re-style the menu bar so that I don't need the line breaks-->

#note
*This app is largely complete. I purposely didn't put pokemon type on the index page but it would probably go there on a real application. (12/27/2017)
