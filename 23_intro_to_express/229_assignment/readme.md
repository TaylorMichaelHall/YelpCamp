#express routing assignment

1. create a brand new express app from scratch
2. create a package.json using npm init and add express as a dependency
3. in your main app.js file, add 3 different routes

visiting / should print "Hi there, welcome to my assignment!"

visiting /speak/pig should print "The pig says 'oink'"
visiting /speak/cow should print "The cow says 'moo'"
visiting /speak/dog should print "The pig says 'woof woof'"

visiting /repeat/hello/3 should print "hello hello hello"
visiting /repeat/hello/5 should print "hello hello hello hello hello"
